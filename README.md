Google App engine

My project checks whether the entered number is a pallindrome and also checks if it is prime.
I have used python as platform for developing it. It also uses two AppEngine features- AppEngine Datastore and Google Usermanagement.

When you go to the link "numberstatistics-1233.appspot.com"
1. You will be intially asked to login
2. You will be redirected to the home page where a greeting with your name will be displayed
3. Enter a number in the available box and click on check
4. You will be redirected to another page where the result will be displayed
5. You can click on GoHome to go back to home page
6. History of last 10 input numbers with their details will be shown below(With the help of AppEngine datastore)
7. You can click on clear anytime to clear the history.
